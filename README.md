Eve is a set of tools to help us think. Currently, these tools include: a temporal query language, a compiler, and a database.

## Installation

### From Source

To build Eve from source, you'll need LuaJIT, gcc, make, and python. Currently, building from source is only supported on Linux and OSX. On Windows, we've managed to compile Eve in cygwin, but have not gotten it to run yet. Contributions are welcome on this front.

Install luajit by downloading [LuaJIT-2.1.0-beta2](http://luajit.org/download.html) and then in the LuaJIT directory:

```
make
make install
```

By default, LuaJIT is not added to your path, so you'll need to do that as well:

```
ln -sf luajit-2.1.0-beta2 /usr/local/bin/luajit
```

then execute `make` in the `eve/build` directory.

### Docker

Eve is also on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/witheve/eve/). You can get our container with the following command:

```
docker pull witheve/eve
```

Windows Users - Docker for Windows requires Microsoft Hyper-V, which requires Windows 10. For users of earlier Windows versions, binaries are forthcoming.

## Running

To run Eve, execute the following command in the `eve/build` directory:

`./eve -e [eve_file]`

where `[eve_file]` is the location of an `*.eve` file you want to compile. This process launches a server at `http://localhost:8080`. You can point your browser there to see the results of the compilation. You can configure the port with the `--port` flag. e.g. `./eve --port 1234`.

To run the Docker container, execute:

```
docker run -p [port]:8080 witheve/eve [eve_file]
```

Here, `[port]` is an available port on your local machine. It can be `8080` or any other port you would like. Then direct your browser to `http://localhost:[port]` to access the results. **Note**: To pass your own Eve files into the container, you'll need to mount a [docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/).

## How to use Eve

You can learn about Eve with the following resources:

- [Syntax Quick Reference](https://github.com/witheve/assets/blob/master/docs/SyntaxReference.pdf)
- [Eve Language Handbook (draft)](https://github.com/witheve/docs/blob/master/drafts/handbook/contents.md)

*Please let us know what kind of documents would be the most helpful as you begin your journey with Eve*. We want our documentation to be a highlight of the Eve experience, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

### How to Contribute

The best way to contribute right now is to write Eve code and report your experiences. Let us know what kind of programs you’re trying to write, what barriers your are facing in writing code (both mental and technological), and any errors you encounter along the way. Also, let us know what you love! What features are your favorite?

Another way to really help us is to host your `*.eve` files on Github, so we can get Eve recognized as an official language in the eyes of Github. Be sure to also send us a link to your repo!

## Disclaimer

Eve is currently at a very early, "pre-alpha" stage of development. This means the language, tools, and docs are largely incomplete, but undergoing rapid and continuous development. If you encounter errors while using Eve, don't worry: it's likely our fault. Please bring the problem to our attention by [filing an issue](https://github.com/witheve/eve#how-to-file-an-issue).

As always, with pre-release software, don’t use this for anything important. We are continuously pushing to this codebase, so you can expect very rapid changes. At this time, we’re not prepared make the commitment that our changes will not break your code, but we’ll do our best to [update you](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) on the biggest changes.
